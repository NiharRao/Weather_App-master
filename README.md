### Explanations
*I chose to develop this app with Vue.js for a few reasons:*
- I know that Vue is relatively lightweight and easy to learn. Vue uses html for its component templates and so for this small application where the styles aren't as important I thought this would be easier 
- It has quite a simple learning curve and so picking it up and taking advantage of the benefits was easy enough. It has some similarities with React and some differences.
- Both have virtual DOMs and structure the application through its components
- I was curious about learning Vue.js and so I decided that this should be my first dive into Vue.js. I have no regrets.
